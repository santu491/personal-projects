    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;This Web site offered by Carelon Behavioral Health, Inc. (the “Carelon Behavioral Health site”) is designed to help you learn more about getting help with life issues that are sensitive, emotional and often private. We respect your personal privacy and provide this informational statement so that you may better understand how we may collect and use aggregate and personal information about you. This Privacy Statement describes Carelon Behavioral Health privacy and security practices for this Web site. Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the Carelon Behavioral Health site also apply to the Carelon Behavioral Health Mobile Device Applications (or “App”) available for mobile devices, including, but not limited to iPhone’s, iPad’s, Android’s and/or other smart devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your acceptance of these terms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;By using this site, you signify your acceptance of the terms of the Carelon Behavioral Health Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not use the Carelon Behavioral Health site and exit the site immediately. Your continued use of the Carelon Behavioral Health site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Internet Protocol (IP) address&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;For each visitor to the Carelon Behavioral Health site, Carelon Behavioral Health servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain name (e.g., carelonbehavioralhealth.com) of visitors. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather general demographic information.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cookies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Carelon Behavioral Health may place a “cookie” on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying&amp;nbsp;information,&amp;nbsp;but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the Carelon Behavioral Health site. Carelon Behavioral Health uses the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes, such as delivery of features and advertisements, so that Carelon Behavioral Health can customize delivery of information specific to your interests without compromising privacy. For example, we may use cookies to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclosing information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Carelon Behavioral Health is the sole owner of the information collected from you on the Carelon Behavioral Health site. We will not sell, share, rent, lease, trade or otherwise provide this information to independent third parties in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Statement.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Carelon Behavioral Health will not disclose your personally identifiable information to independent third parties other than those who help us operate the Carelon Behavioral Health site. We may also share aggregated demographic and profile information (information that does not allow you to be identified or contacted) with our business partners for marketing and promotional purposes. The aggregate information we share with our business partners is not linked to any of your personally identifiable information. For example, Carelon Behavioral Health may provide information to third parties about how many people use our Web site, what features of the Web site they use and how many users of the Web site live in certain zip codes.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Carelon Behavioral Health may disclose account information in special cases (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when Carelon Behavioral Health has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to Carelon Behavioral Health users or other persons or violating the Terms and Conditions of this site.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;In the event that Carelon Behavioral Health, or any component of Carelon Behavioral Healths’ operations, is merged with, or is acquired by, another entity, then any such successor or acquiring entity may become the successor to our obligations with respect to the personal information that you have provided to Carelon Behavioral Health, which would be necessary for the entity to effectively continue Carelon Behavioral Healths’ business. By using the Carelon Behavioral Health site, you consent to any such use of your personal information by such an entity assuming control of Carelon Behavioral Healths’ operations as a result of a merger, purchase of Carelon Behavioral Health assets, or liquidation of Carelon Behavioral Health in bankruptcy or insolvency.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Links&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;This site contains links to other sites. Carelon Behavioral Health is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, including any sites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with Carelon Behavioral Health (such as co-branded pages and “powered by” relationships). Carelon Behavioral Health does not disclose unique identifiers to those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not subject to Carelon Behavioral Healths’ control. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of the sites you visit by linking from our Web site.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our partner sites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the services accessible to you from the Carelon Behavioral Health site are actually performed by our partners. You can tell whether you are on the Carelon Behavioral Health site or a partner site by checking the Internet address (URL) in your browser window. When you are on our partner sites, you are governed by our partner’s privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mobile device applications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;When you download and install one of our Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the App, and please use your mobile device browser to access the Carelon Behavioral Health site or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses. Please note that certain Apps require registration either to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Carelon Behavioral Healths’ Apps obtain your consent (via an opt-in) before using information from pin-pointing technology like GPS or cell tower information. You can withdraw your consent (opt-out) for the use of “location” by Carelon Behavioral Health at any time by changing your location services in the “Settings” function on your mobile device.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children’s privacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. You should be aware that the Carelon Behavioral Health site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your role in protecting your privacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;If you share a terminal with others, you may want to consider establishing an anonymous e-mail account. In this way, e-mails that your receive from Carelon Behavioral Health, which may reflect behavioral health issues of interest to you, cannot be linked to you. If you access  &lt;a href="https://www.carelonbehavioralhealth.com"&gt;carelonbehavioralhealth.com&lt;/a&gt; through an e-mail account or internet access system maintained by your employer, please note that it is possible that your employer may monitor your e-mail communications and Internet use.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notification of changes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;This Privacy Statement may be revised over time as new features are added to the Web site or as Internet security and privacy standards evolve. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Statement each time you use the Carelon Behavioral Health site, in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Statement.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contacting us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, the practices of the Carelon Behavioral Health site or your dealings with Carelon Behavioral Health, you can contact us at:&lt;/p&gt;
