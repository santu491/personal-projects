Provider Search offers you the ability to locate Carelon network providers and facilities throughout the country. The use of this provider directory does not provide authorization for benefits or services. Prior to beginning any care or program with a provider, you should contact Carelon Behavioral Health to obtain benefits and be notified of any requirements specific to your benefit plan where applicable. If you are unable to locate a network provider through our directory, please call the number on the back of your health insurance card for assistance in locating a network provider.&lt;/p&gt;
