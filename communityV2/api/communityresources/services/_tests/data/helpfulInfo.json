For some folks with prediabetes, moderate lifestyle changes can actually bring blood sugar levels back to a normal range, which can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Below are six healthy habits you can do daily that are recommended by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) who specialize in prediabetes.</p> \n<h2>1. Fill half (or more) of your plate with fruits and vegetables.</h2> \n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 1 in 10 Americans consume the recommended five to nine servings of fruits and veggies per day. These foods are brimming with nutrients and fiber and are lower in calories. Plus, according to Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN, founder of NutritionStarringYOU.com and author of <cite>The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook, </cite>\"The antioxidants and phytochemicals in fruits and veggies can play a role in improving insulin resistance, which can help to better control blood sugar.” Filling your plate at least half full of them at each meal or snack is a great way to make sure you’re meeting your needs.</p> \n<p>“Once you do this, you’ll find you’ll never be hungry eating moderate-sized portions of starchy foods and protein-rich foods,” says Jill Weisenberger, M.S., RDN, CDCES, CHWC, FAND, creator of the free guide <cite>Can I Eat That with Prediabetes?&nbsp;</cite>“The non-starchy vegetables are low-calorie, low-carb, and very filling. Plus, they’re jam-packed with health-boosting phytonutrients that act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.”</p> \n<h2>2. Manage your stress.</h2> \n<p>Harris-Pincus explains, “Chronic stress can wreak havoc on health and well-being by hindering your immunity, making you susceptible to many types of illnesses. Plus, stress hormones like cortisol can contribute to weight gain and elevated blood sugar.”&nbsp;She suggests adding stretching exercises, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to your daily routine:&nbsp;“Make time for self-care by choosing a relaxing activity you enjoy—preferably off of screens, like knitting, painting, word puzzles, listening to music, or reading a good book.”</p> \n<h2>3. Get your sleep.</h2> \n<p>Did you know that not getting enough sleep not only makes you cranky, but also makes you less likely to stick to your healthy-eating goals? In addition, Weisenberger says it actually messes with your body’s response to insulin. “Short-sleeping changes levels of growth hormone and cortisol, which makes us more insulin-resistant. Even a single night of lousy sleep can make you more insulin-resistant the following day.\" According to the CDC, adults should aim for seven hours of sleep per night.</p> \n<h2>4. Avoid binge drinking.</h2> \n<p>According to Lorena Drago, M.S., RDN, CDN,&nbsp;CDCES, a certified diabetes care and education specialist, binge drinking is defined as “four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men in about two hours, which can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.”&nbsp;Binge drinking can cause the pancreas to become inflamed and unable to secrete insulin as a result of&nbsp;excessive alcohol consumption. If you choose to drink alcohol, the recommendation is no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. One drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces of beer, 5 fluid ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor like rum or vodka.</p> \n<h2>5. Get moving.</h2> \n<p>“Prolonged sitting, including spending many hours watching television or in front of a computer,&nbsp;may accelerate your risk of developing type 2 diabetes,” Drago explains. “Lack of exercise is a major contributor to chronic disease. Physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity, increases how the muscles use blood glucose (sugar), and improves insulin resistance.” Drago recommends doing at least 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week. To help you stick with it, pick a type of movement you really enjoy instead of trying to force yourself to do something you don’t like. That could be yoga, dancing, lifting weights, swimming, cycling, running, or more.</p> \n<h2>6. Follow a plant-based diet.</h2> \n<p>“Powerful plant-based foods like nuts, seeds, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and legumes contain disease-fighting nutrients that can reduce your risk for heart disease, lower your cholesterol, help manage your blood sugar, and improve your mood,” says Toby Smithson, RDN, LD, CDCES, FAND, a diabetes lifestyle expert and founder of DiabetesEveryDay.com and author of <cite>Diabetes Meal Planning and Nutrition for Dummies.</cite> “A plant-based diet is effective in lowering the risk of developing type 2 diabetes because it is higher in fiber, lower in saturated fat, and improves insulin sensitivity. Proof is in the pudding, as long as your pudding is plant-based. The research shows this type of eating pattern is associated with a 30% reduction in diabetes risk.”</p>",

                    "description": "<p>Ever wonder&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;what happens in your body when you exercise? Wonder no more. Here’s what happens before, during, and after exercise.</p> \n<h2>Before exercise</h2> \n<p>At rest, two hormones from your pancreas—insulin and glucagon—play opposing roles to keep your blood sugar stable: Insulin moves sugar into your cells and glucagon shuttles sugar out of cells. After you eat, sugar and other nutrients are released into your blood from your intestines. Insulin levels rise to move that sugar into your cells, including muscle and liver cells, to be used or stored. Between meals, glucagon levels rise to maintain your blood sugar by releasing that stored glucose back into your bloodstream—preventing low blood sugar.</p> \n<h2>During exercise</h2> \n<h3>The Warmup</h3> \n<p>It’s time to get your heart pumping. As you start to move, your muscles use their own stored sugar as well as sugar from the bloodstream to make an energy compound (called ATP) that helps them contract. And soon&nbsp;your hungry muscles need more sugar to make that fuel. So your body gradually lowers insulin levels and raises glucagon levels to release more stored sugar (from your liver) into your bloodstream for muscles to use.</p> \n<p>At rest, muscles require insulin to absorb glucose, so how does that released sugar enter active muscle cells with only a small amount of insulin? First, working muscles place more transporters on the surface of their cells that act like doors for insulin to deposit sugar into. The more doors, the more sensitive cells are to insulin, even with less of it floating around. And second, active muscles can also absorb glucose on their own without insulin, so less insulin is needed. Both pathways prompt muscles to absorb excess glucose, helping to lower high blood sugar.</p> \n<h3>The Workout</h3> \n<p>Now you’re in the swing of your activity, be it dancing, walking, swimming, or a body-weight circuit. To keep your muscles happy, your body releases other hormones, like adrenaline, that free even more stored glucose from the liver. How much sugar is released depends on how long and how hard you go.</p> \n<p>During intense activities (think: short sprints with little downtime, or a hard lifting session), adrenaline may release more sugar than your muscles can use, which can raise blood sugar for up to two hours post-exercise. This temporary spike is common and typically does not impact your A1C, though it may need to be balanced through food or medicine post-workout.</p> \n<h2>After exercise</h2> \n<p>While you cool down, catch your breath, and sip water, your muscles and liver are still hard at work absorbing sugar out of the blood to replenish their stores for next time. And those good effects that happened during exercise—improved insulin action and sensitivity—may remain enhanced for up to 48 hours post-sweat.</p> \n<p>Heart-pumping aerobic activities aren’t the only form of exercise that's beneficial: Resistance training can also increase glucose uptake and reduce insulin resistance. That’s why combo workouts (think: water aerobics, body-weight circuits, or even walk-then-lift sessions) may be the most effective for blood glucose management.</p> \n<h2>Working out with insulin</h2> \n<p>How muscles use glucose during exercise is the same for all people. But people who have&nbsp;type 1 diabetes, and those who take insulin, often need to take extra steps to avoid blood sugar swings and lows during activity. This may mean adjusting insulin dosages or eating a source of glucose before or during exercise. If blood sugar levels rise after a hard effort, it may seem intuitive to treat raised levels with an insulin dose, but this rise is temporary and taking insulin could increase the risk for a delayed low.</p> \n<p>Navigating your body’s response to physical activity when on insulin can be frustrating, but finding a regular exercise routine that works for you is possible. Have patience with yourself and take the necessary precautions: Check your blood sugar before working out, pack a source of glucose, and listen to your body.</p>",

                    "description": "<p>Cancer and its treatment can weaken the immune system. So, when cooking for yourself or someone else with cancer, it’s critical to practice good food-safety habits. Here’s a quick review of the basics.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Keep it clean.</h2> \n<p>Before cooking, wash your hands and prep surfaces with warm or hot soapy water. If produce will be eaten raw, wash it thoroughly first—even prewashed salad greens—with plenty of cold running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub produce that won’t be peeled.</p> \n<h2>Keep them separate.</h2> \n<p>To avoid cross-contamination with disease-causing bacteria, keep cutting boards and prep areas for raw meats, poultry, fish, and eggs separate from the ones you use to prepare cooked foods or vegetables, salads, and other dishes meant to be eaten raw.</p> \n<h2>Hold it safely.</h2> \n<p>If you’re not serving food right away, keep it at a safe temperature, but for no more than two hours. Hot food should be at or above 140°F; cold food below 40°F. If you have a hot dish you’re planning to deliver later, chill it first. Divide it into smaller, shallow containers or place it on&nbsp;ice or in a cold-water bath to cool quickly. Put it in the fridge when it reaches 140°F.</p> \n<h2>Send it safely.</h2> \n<p>Bringing a meal to someone? Pack it in an insulated container and make sure someone is there to receive it and refrigerate it right away. If that’s not possible, use a cooler with at least two ice packs. Again, do not leave anything at room temperature for more than 2 hours.</p> \n<h2>Watch the temps.</h2> \n<p>Use a food thermometer to ensure foods are fully cooked. That's especially important when you're heating or reheating food in the microwave, which can have hot and cold spots. Measure temperature in the center or in the thickest part of the food.</p> \n<h2>Safe Cooking Temperatures</h2> \n<p>The USDA recommends cooking these foods to the following minimum internal temperatures. While the guidelines apply to everyone, they’re especially important for people with cancer, as some treatments can weaken the body’s ability to fight off infection. Use an instant-read thermometer to confirm.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Ground meats: 160°F</li> \n <li>All poultry (parts, whole, ground): 165°F</li> \n <li>Fish and shellfish: 145°F, or until flesh is opaque or shells open.</li> \n <li>Steaks, roasts, and chops: 145°F</li> \n <li>Casseroles and leftovers: 165°F</li> \n <li>Eggs and egg dishes: Cook until firm or to 160°F.</li> \n</ul>",

Women can be especially bad about asking for help, perhaps because they're so used to taking care of other people. But this is no time to be stoic or polite.</p> \n<h2>Friends and family</h2> \n<p>\"You're not Wonder Woman and you can't do everything—and that's OK,\" says Karen R. Monaghan, LICSW, a clinical oncology social worker at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \"It's hard for people to say, 'I need someone to clean my bathroom.' But don't be afraid to reach out.\"</p> \n<p>When you organize your cancer-fighting team, whether formally or in the natural course of things in your family or community, let someone else be the point person, the one others can call to check on how you're doing and see where they can help. Or put that information online at&nbsp;CaringBridge.org.</p> \n<h2>Providers</h2> \n<p>Being able to reach out to your medical team is just as important. You have to be able to speak freely with the key people fighting to make you well, and you should understand what they're asking you to do and why. If you have questions, keep asking them until the answers make sense.</p> \n<p>If doctor-patient communication is not as open and effective as you'd like, change that. \"You&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to be able to communicate with your oncologist,\" stresses Pam T., 54, of Seattle. \"If you don't like [your doctor], then you need to get another one. This is too serious a matter to not be understanding what they're saying to you.\"</p>",

                    "title": "Working Out but Not Losing Weight? Here's Why",
                    "description": "<p>Do you eat well, exercise often&nbsp;and still feel like you’re not maintaining a healthy weight? Truth is, eating well and exercising often are very relative and general statements. If we’re honest with ourselves, we might all&nbsp;admit that we’re capable of trying a little harder in both areas.</p> \n<p>Total-body wellness is a lifestyle. Fat loss happens when you ditch the scale, find an activity you enjoy&nbsp;and start to see food as fuel instead of something to feed your emotions or occupy your time.</p> \n<p>No matter who you are or what your background is, chances are one of these six reasons could be why you’re not shedding pounds.</p> \n<h2>1. You’re not eating the good stuff.</h2> \n<p>If you’re working out but not losing weight, the first place you should be looking is the kitchen. Some people focus so much energy on burning off calories that they don’t take the time to consider what they’re putting in as fuel. A good rule of thumb is to stick to all-natural, whole foods.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for foods that have the fewest ingredients on the label, if you can’t pronounce it, it’s probably not something you want to be putting in your body.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>2. You’re doing too much cardio.</h2> \n<p>Yes, cardio is a necessary part of your workout routine. It keeps your heart healthy, boosts your metabolism&nbsp;and gives you a good sweat.</p> \n<p>However, only doing cardio (or doing too much of it) can&nbsp;add to the problem. Longer cardio sessions, like staying on the elliptical for 90 minutes or going for regular 10-mile runs, can eat away at your lean muscle mass, which is essential for increasing your metabolism to burn more calories. It causes the body to become more endurance-focused, storing energy as fat to ensure it has plenty of reserve fuel to keep you going for all those miles. Not to mention it dramatically increases your appetite, making you more susceptible to unnecessary snacking or overeating.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Federal guidelines for physical activity suggest that adults also do strength training,&nbsp;focusing on all major muscle groups, two or more days a week.</p> \n<h2>3. You’re not lifting weights.</h2> \n<p>If you love to run or bike for reasons other than losing weight, then by all means don’t stop. But if you’re working out but not losing weight, and your primary goal is fat loss, there are other forms of exercise that give a much better bang for your buck. The best way to lose weight and build lean muscle is by doing some form of strength training in addition to your cardio. The more muscle tone your body has, the more fat you’ll burn.</p> \n<p>If you’re not ready to give up your cardio routine just yet, try adding some interval training by performing short bursts of all-out effort mixed into your regular session. These workouts are much more effective at promoting hormones that target stubborn fat. Then, start adding some resistance training to your routine.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Body-weight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges are a great place to start to help build up to lifting actual weights.</p> \n<h2>4. You’re not working hard enough.</h2> \n<p>There’s no exact equation to working out and eating healthy—it’s a matter of trial and error, finding out what works specifically for your body. And more time spent in the gym doesn’t always equal a more fit person.&nbsp;Your workouts should be intensity-dependent, not time-dependent. Keep this fact in mind: the harder you work, the shorter your workout time may need to be.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Maximize time spent at the gym, in fitness class, or in your at-home workout routine so you can achieve that coveted after-burn effect, which keeps your metabolism revved for 24 to 48 hours afterward.</p> \n<h2>5. You’re not taking time to recover.</h2> \n<p>Recovery and rest are often more important than the workout itself. It’s during those periods that your body does most of the actual fat burning.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Give yourself time to fully recover so you’re ready to work hard the following day. Most importantly, listen to your body. Push yourself, but give it some love, too.</p> \n<h2>6. You’ve plateaued.</h2> \n<p>You’re exercising regularly and eating healthfully, but now the numbers on the scale won’t budge; your weight loss has plateaued. There are lots of reasons this can happen, says the Mayo Clinic. If you’re cutting calories, you may experience a rapid drop in weight initially, as your body burns stored glycogen for energy. You might even lose a little muscle along with fat. To rev up your weight loss again, you may need to cut more calories or amp up your physical activity.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Add resistance training to build muscle and burn fat.</p>",

                    "description": "<p>A solid night of shut-eye is so crucial for our body and mind, yet most of us don’t get what we truly need. Many Americans report sleeping only about seven hours a night, and lots of us log even fewer hours, which is when it becomes unhealthy.</p> \n<p>“Adequate sleep helps to allow your body to perform all the regulatory and maintenance functions it needs to function properly. Healthy sleep also helps set the stage for many domains of health,” says Michael A. Grandner, Ph.D., M.T.R., director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.</p> \n<p>A recently published research review, which Grandner authored, shows that insufficient sleep can shorten your lifespan, stoke inflammation, raise your risk of diabetes and heart disease, and negatively affect your mental health.</p> \n<p>But what about your weight? Does sleep play a role in the number we see on the scale? We dug into the science.</p> \n<h2>Does sleep influence&nbsp;your appetite?</h2> \n<p>When we fall short on sleep, research shows our levels of ghrelin (the hormone that makes us feel hungry) go up, and our levels of leptin (the hormone that helps us to feel full) dip, explains Grandner. Also, when leptin levels rise—which appears to happen during sleep—it counter-regulates ghrelin and has the potential to tamp down your hunger.</p> \n<p>Falling short on sleep also disrupts how your body regulates insulin and glucose, as well as other substances in the body that regulate hunger and appetite.</p> \n<h2>Can sleep help or hinder your weight-loss goals?</h2> \n<p>Skimping on shut-eye has the potential to make losing weight that much harder. Here’s why: “Not only does lack of sleep disrupt hormones that regulate hunger and appetite, it also leads to increased eating of unhealthy foods at night, decreases energy level which leads to craving energy [aka food], and even impairs brain function, which makes it harder to make healthy choices,” explains Grandner.</p> \n<p>Take a look at the research on the topic and you’ll see that there is a connection between sleep and body weight. Research shows that folks who consistently fall short on sleep weigh more over time than their counterparts who get adequate sleep. Other studies have found that dieters who lose even just a little bit of sleep aren’t as successful at losing weight compared to dieters who log enough zzz’s. For instance, one study, published in <cite>Sleep</cite>,&nbsp;put one group of adults on a calorie-restricted diet and told them to cut out about one hour of sleep five days a week (the other two days they could sleep as much as they wanted). Another group went on the same calorie-restricted diet. The findings? Compared to the dieters who didn’t limit their sleep, the sleep- deprived&nbsp;group lost less body fat. Both groups, however, lost about the same amount of total body weight.</p> \n<p>All of this said, there are some studies that suggest the impact of sleep on weight isn’t&nbsp;all that significant (statistically speaking, too). And then there’s research&nbsp;that found men to be more likely than women to pack on the extra pounds when their sleep is lacking.</p> \n<h2>So, how many hours of sleep should you aim for?</h2> \n<p>Is there a magic number you need to get to best support your diet and meet your weight-loss goals? “Most of the evidence shows that most adults need at least seven hours of sleep on a typical night, and probably not more than nine hours,” advises Grandner.

                    "description": "<p>The dangers of screen time are well-documented and well-known;&nbsp;i.e., too much screen time can cause developmental delays or have social implications or both. Behavioral problems may also arise, particularly in children who spend two hours a day (or more) on the TV, computer, tablet, or phone. And there are physical effects, too. Too much screen time can lead to eye strain, pain, and childhood obesity. In short, there are inherent risks. But there are benefits as well. Yes, screen time can actually be a good thing.</p> \n<p>According to an October 2019 study out of Oxford, Cardiff, and Cambridge universities, screen time&nbsp;in moderation can have a positive effect on kids. Watching television or using digital devices can increase one’s social and emotional well-being.</p> \n<p>“In light of our findings, calls for blanket technology bans and age restrictions on technology access do not constitute evidence-based or indeed ethical advice, particularly as screen usage in some cases has a net positive impact,” said Professor Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute,&nbsp;in a release. What’s more, a July 2020 report, from the nonprofit Common Sense Media, suggested that parents should focus more on what their kids are consuming and less on how many hours they’re logging.</p> \n<p>“All screen use is not equal,” Michael Robb, an author of the report and senior director of research at Common Sense Media, told CNN. This became particularly apparent in the height of the pandemic, when children were using computers to attend class and interacting with their peers. Below are five benefits of screen time.</p> \n<h2>1. Improves socialization</h2> \n<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, screen time can&nbsp;improve your child’s social and emotional well-being. According to Internet Matters, “Technology&nbsp;takes away physical barriers to social connections—which is important for children who find it hard to make friends or have special interests or special needs.” It can be used for both conversations and play. Many kids video-called their friends in early 2020, when lockdowns forced them to stay home. They held tea parties and playdates over the web. And social media platforms can foster a sense of community and connectedness.</p> \n<h2>2. Enhances critical thinking</h2> \n<p>Not all apps and video games are created equal. That’s a fact. But did you know some may encourage learning and enhance critical thinking skills? “A lot of these games won’t even feel like learning,” says Caroline Knorr, senior parenting editor at&nbsp;Common Sense Media. “But parents know time playing is time well spent with puzzles and games that challenge kids to experiment and find creative ways to solve problems.”</p> \n<h2>3. Promotes school readiness</h2> \n<p>From educational games and apps to digital books, or e-books, screens can promote school readiness. Some television programs even encourage reading, spelling, math skills, and writing. And while the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend screen usage for children under 18 months, high-quality apps and programs can be a great learning tool for kids older than that. Co-play with your toddlers because that's how they learn best.</p> \n<h2>4. Helps&nbsp;development of fine motor skills</h2> \n<p>Working on computers and playing video games can help your child improve their hand-eye coordination, Internet Matters explains. Interacting with computers improves both visual intelligence and hand-eye coordination,” the website states. It also affects their coordination.</p> \n<p>“Playing video games can improve motor skills,” Nemours Children’s Health adds.</p> \n<h2>5. Encourages literacy and communication</h2> \n<p>While it may seem odd to suggest that screens can (and do) improve literacy and communication skills, it’s true. E-books improve our reading proficiency. They also give us access to a wide and varied library, larger than most people could have in their home. Texting can help kids learn to read and spell. And various apps and computer programs encourage communication, from emails and notes to messaging, Word&nbsp;and Google Docs.</p> \n<p>That said, it’s still important to balance time in front of the computer with other activities. Sitting in front of the TV or staring at your phone all the time is not good or healthy. It can have adverse effects. So, what exactly can parents do to ensure their kids are consuming quality content? Be involved, be aware of how your children are engaging with digital media, and try to help your kids find a balance of online and offline activities. Experts recommend following the “Three C’s”: Child, content, and context. That is, you know what’s best for your child, but you can also try to help them prioritize quality content.</p>",

                    "title": "How to Teach Kids to Swim at Every Age",
                    "description": "<p>Tempted to sign your little one up for swimming lessons this summer? That’s a smart move, considering that drowning is a top cause of death among children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p> \n<p>“While no course can ‘drown-proof’ a child, a progressive learn-to-swim program can provide your child with skills that will last a lifetime,” says Connie Harvey, national health-and-safety expert for the American Red Cross.</p> \n<p>Always take the time to research swim lessons before enrolling. Classes should focus on both swimming skills and “water survival competency skills,” says the AAP, and they should be taught by instructors certified through a nationally recognized learn-to-swim curriculum. “There should also be lifeguards on duty who have current CPR and First Aid certification,” adds the organization. What’s more, the lessons should be age-appropriate, and the water should be kept warm and clean.</p> \n<p>Whether you enroll in swim lessons or take to the backyard pool, here’s how to teach a child to swim at every age.</p> \n<h2>1 to 2 years old</h2> \n<p>At this age, you simply want to introduce your child to the water. Play in the pool with them, or join a class that focuses on having fun and getting comfortable in the water (instead of learning to swim). Activities may include showing them how to splash, singing songs while bobbing around, and playing gentle games together.</p> \n<h3>Safety tips:</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Keep your baby in your arms at all times.</li> \n <li>Do not submerge any child under age 3. Kids this age can swallow a large amount of water, enough to dilute the chemicals in their blood, causing sleepiness, nausea, and seizures. In rare cases, water intoxication can be fatal.</li> \n <li>An infant can drown in an inch or two of water in less than 30 seconds, so beware of all water hazards, including inflatable baby pools, buckets, toilets, and tubs.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>2 to 3 years old</h2> \n<p>Wondering how to teach a toddler to swim? Your curious tot will be more active in the water now, though they still need an adult to hold them. In your pool or swimming program, play fun games that encourage them to move their arms, kick their legs, and float supported on their stomach or back.</p> \n<p>Show them how to blow bubbles in the water so they learn to get their face wet without swallowing. By the time they’re 3, they may be able to do these things with little help from you.</p> \n<h3>Safety tips:</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Your toddler may feel so comfortable in the water that they think they can swim solo. But don’t leave them alone. Even for a minute. They need constant adult supervision around water.</li> \n <li>Stress basic pool safety, like not running near the pool and only going into the water with Mommy or Daddy.</li> \n <li>Avoid water wings, air-filled swimsuits, and inflatable flotation toys. Your toddler will sink if they deflate, and these items can give them (and you) a false sense of security.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>4 to 5 years old</h2> \n<p>Now that your child is developing enough coordination to swim by themselves, they can enroll in formal swimming lessons. If they don’t have much experience in the water, choose a program that will help them get comfortable. You might be allowed to participate in their first class to make the transition easier.</p> \n<p>In the shallow water, your child should learn how to float independently, submerge their head under the water for 5 to 10 seconds, go from a standing to a swimming position without assistance, glide through the water, reach an exit point, and use coordinated kicking and arm movements. Their swimming class should focus on both water and safety skills.</p> \n<h3>Safety tips:</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Even though you don’t have to hold your child, a guardian should practice “reach supervision” by being in the water within reaching distance.</li> \n <li>Be patient. Your child may be a fish one day and afraid of the water the next. Don’t force them to do an activity until they’re ready.</li> \n <li>Never assume another adult is watching, even if a lifeguard is present.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>6 years old and up</h2> \n<p>An older child can hold their breath for longer periods of time, swim underwater, and retrieve objects at the bottom. They’ll be able to jump into the water and resurface on their own. They can start learning all swimming strokes, including the breaststroke and backstroke. Their greater endurance will allow them to swim longer distances.</p> \n<p>At this point, you don’t have to be in the water with your child, but you still need to supervise all pool activities&nbsp;because they may overestimate their own abilities.</p> \n<h3>Safety tips:</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>An adult should watch all water activities. Even a good swimmer can drown.</li> \n <li>Make it a rule that your child can swim only with an adult present, and encourage them to always swim with a buddy.</li> \n <li>You should be extra vigilant at the beach or a lake. A child’s swimming skills in a pool don’t necessarily translate to open water.</li> \n</ul>",

                    "description": "<p>Pregnancy is supposed to be a joyful time, but for many women, the first trimester can be rough. Here are a few tips to help you get through the first months.</p> \n<h2>Look for relief from your nausea.</h2> \n<p>Morning sickness can be the roughest part of early pregnancy. But not all is lost. Many women find small lifestyle changes can make a big difference when it comes to vomiting and nausea. Some things to try: eating bland foods like saltines in the morning, before you even get out of bed; eating more frequent, smaller meals; snacking on ginger candies or sipping ginger soda; and avoiding offending smells. Although medical studies on acupuncture and&nbsp;morning sickness haven’t shown significant benefits, many women who’ve been through severe nausea and vomiting swear by it.</p> \n<h2>Try chewable prenatal vitamins.</h2> \n<p>Many women with&nbsp;morning sickness&nbsp;find that swallowing pills can be hard or trigger a gag reflex, but taking&nbsp;prenatal vitamins is key to making sure your developing&nbsp;fetus&nbsp;has the building blocks it needs. Thankfully, there are lots of chewable prenatal vitamins out there. Choose an iron-free formulation until your morning sickness passes, since iron can make nausea worse.</p> \n<h2>Keep moving.</h2> \n<p>Exercise is a pregnant woman’s best medicine. Regular exercise can help you sleep better so that you’re not so exhausted during the first trimester. Not only that, but regular activity can also help improve your mood and can help get you in condition for&nbsp;labor. Try to keep up with a regular routine, like going for a morning walk before work or taking a mid-day stroll with a coworker. If it’s been a while since you worked out, you can ease yourself into it, starting with about five minutes a day, until you can exercise for 30 minutes at a time. But first, make sure to get the green light from your doctor before starting or stepping up your fitness regime.</p> \n<h2>Floss away.</h2> \n<p>Clean teeth are more important than ever. Pregnancy&nbsp;hormones can make your gums temporarily swollen and sensitive. But that doesn’t mean you can postpone your regular twice-a-year professional cleanings, since the inflammation caused by gum disease has been linked to preterm birth. For the next nine months, make sure to brush twice a day and floss daily. Another tooth tip: Don’t brush your teeth right away if you vomit from&nbsp;morning sickness. The acids can harm your enamel. Instead, rinse with warm water and brush your tongue. You can go back and brush your teeth after about 10 minutes.</p> \n<h2>Make sure to put yourself first.</h2> \n<p>You might be tempted to focus all your attention on your growing baby, but it’s important to focus some attention on your own self-care, especially your emotional well-being. Pregnancy can be a stressful time for many moms-to-be. You’re learning about how to care for your new child, undergoing bodily changes, and having to rethink parts of your lifestyle. Make sure to take time each week for yourself, relax, take a long bath, and ask your partner to take on some chores while you put your feet up. Talk with your doctor about ways you can manage stress&nbsp;and be sure to speak up if you’re feeling anxious, worried, sad, or depressed.</p>",

Here, the dos and don’ts of exercise, health, and mental health during pregnancy.</p> \n<h2>Pregnancy Exercise</h2> \n<p>Exercise is not only safe during most pregnancies, but it also may ease many pregnancy discomforts and possibly shorten your labor and delivery and recovery time.</p> \n<h3>The Dos of Pregnancy Exercise</h3> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Exercise moderately for at least 30 minutes on most days, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Stick with low-impact exercises such as walking, yoga, and swimming.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Stay cool and drink plenty of water. Dehydration can lead to overheating, which is dangerous for the fetus. Drink before, during, and after exercise.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Wear workout clothes that don’t constrict your rib cage as you breathe.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Stretch before and after exercise. Prenatal yoga is a great way to stay flexible and strong.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Build your strength. Focus on your back, shoulders, pectorals (chest), and biceps so they’ll keep you strong enough to pick up and hold your baby.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Do Kegel exercises daily to help prevent urinary incontinence. Repeatedly contract and relax your pelvic floor muscles as though you’re stopping and starting the flow of urine.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>The Don’ts of Pregnancy Exercise</h3> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Don’t work out to the point of exhaustion. Make sure you can still carry on a conversation while you’re exercising.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t keep exercising if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t get overheated. Consider early-morning or evening walks or go to an air-conditioned gym.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t lift heavy weights, lie on your stomach or back, or use machines that require wearing a belt around your waist.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t tackle high-impact sports or activities in which you risk falling or injuring your abdomen, such as in-line skating, soccer, downhill skiing, and horseback riding.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t exercise if you experience any of the following: an incompetent cervix; pregnancy with multiple risk factors for premature labor; persistent second- or third-trimester bleeding; placenta previa past 26 weeks; premature labor; ruptured membranes; or preeclampsia.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Staying Healthy</h2> \n<p>Expert prenatal care from a doctor or licensed midwife sets the stage for a healthy pregnancy and baby.</p> \n<h3>The Do’s of Pregnancy Health</h3> \n<ul> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Get a checkup as soon as you know you are pregnant. Regular weight, blood pressure, and fetal heart-rate checks will help detect any medical complications early.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Take care of your teeth. Mouth infections are linked to prematurity.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Take it easy at work. If you’re on your feet all day, look for ways to sit down as often as possible.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Seek treatment for other health conditions you may have. Left untreated, these may pose risks to your fetus.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Call your doctor or midwife immediately if you experience any of the following: calf pain or swelling; chest pain;&nbsp;decreased fetal movement; vaginal bleeding; labored breathing without exertion; dizziness; persistent headache; leakage of amniotic fluid; muscle weakness; uterine contractions, abdominal pain&nbsp;or increased pelvic pressure.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>The Don’ts of Pregnancy Health</h3> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Don’t take any medication—prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal—without checking with your doctor or midwife.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t take aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen unless they’re prescribed by your doctor, as they may cause fetal bleeding. Acetaminophen is usually okay, but ask your doctor.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t stop taking medication for a chronic condition such as asthma without checking with your doctor.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t smoke or use any type of illicit drugs.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t forget to wear gloves when changing the cat litter or gardening. Cat feces in litter or soil may transmit toxoplasmosis, which can cause neurological problems in your baby.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t sit in hot tubs or saunas. Hot environments can raise your body temperature and interfere with fetal brain development.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t handle oil-based paints or materials containing lead or mercury. Avoid chemical solvents, oven-cleaning products, and dry-cleaning chemicals.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Mental Health during Pregnancy</h2> \n<p>Stress can contribute to premature birth, low birth weight, and problems with fetal development. Signs that your stress level is too high include constant fatigue and worry, feeling out of control, and being overactive.</p> \n<h3>The Do’s of Pregnancy Mental Health</h3> \n<ul> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Learn relaxation techniques such as visualization and meditation. Spend 20 minutes a day breathing slowly and deeply, progressively relaxing all the muscles in your body.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Get enough sleep. Go to bed earlier, sleep later, or take a nap in the afternoon if you can. A body pillow may help you sleep better.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Lean on friends and family members as much as you need to. Social support is a great antidote to stress.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>See your doctor if stress interferes with your ability to function.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>The Don’ts of Pregnancy Mental Health</h3> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Don’t take on unnecessary stress such as changing jobs or buying a house, if at all possible.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t worry too much about the pain of labor. Today, you have more natural and pharmaceutical pain-relief options than ever. Plus, millions of women make it through labor each year. If they can do it, so can you.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Don’t forget that this is one of the most exciting and rewarding times of your life, one that you will always remember. Enjoy!</p> </li> \n</ul>",

                    "description": "<p><span>What is safe sleep?</span></p><p>Safe sleep means putting your baby to sleep in ways that can help protect him from dangers, like choking and suffocation (not being able to breathe), and sudden infant death syndrome (also called SIDS). SIDS is the unexplained death of a baby younger than 1 year old. SIDS usually happens when a baby is sleeping. It&#8217;s sometimes called crib death because the baby often dies in his crib.</p><p><span>How much sleep does your baby need?</span></p><p>Newborns sleep about 16 hours a day, usually in 3- to 4-hour periods. Your baby needs to eat every few hours, which is why she doesn&#8217;t sleep for longer periods of time. Your baby may get cranky or overtired if she doesn&#8217;t get enough sleep.</p><p>Don&#8217;t be surprised if your baby can only stay awake for an hour or two. Over time, her body gets into a sleep pattern. She starts sleeping for longer stretches, even during the night. If you&#8217;re worried about your baby&#8217;s sleep, talk to her health care provider.</p><p><span>Where should your baby sleep? &#160;</span></p><p>The safest place for your baby to sleep is by herself in a bassinet or crib. If you have&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/find-support/topics/pregnancy/being-pregnant-twins-triplets-and-other-multiples\" title=\"Being pregnant with twins, triplets and other multiples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multiples (twins, triplets or more)</a>, put each baby in his own bassinet or crib. Here are some do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts about making your baby&#8217;s sleep space safe:</p><p><span>Do&#8217;s</span></p><ul><li><span>Do put your baby to sleep on his back on a flat, firm surface,</span>&#160;like a crib mattress covered with a tightly fitted sheet. Use only the mattress made for your baby&#8217;s crib. The mattress should fit snugly in the crib so there are no spaces between the mattress and the crib frame. The mattress shape should stay firm even when covered with a tightly fitted sheet or mattress cover.</li><li><span>Do put your baby to bed in his own crib or bassinet.</span>&#160;Don&#8217;t bed-share. This is when babies and parents sleep together in the same bed. Bed-sharing is the most common cause of death in babies younger than 3 months old. Keep your baby&#8217;s crib close to your bed so your baby&#8217;s nearby during the night. The&#160;<a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"American Academy of Pediatrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>&#160;(also called AAP) recommends that you and your baby sleep in the same room, but not in the same bed, for the first year of your baby&#8217;s life but at least for the first 6 months</li><li><span>Do make sure your baby&#8217;s bassinet, crib or play yard meets current safety standards.&#160;</span>Visit the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/\" title=\"U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</a>&#160;to learn more about product safety standards or product recalls.</li><li><span>Do remove hanging window cords or electrical wires near where your baby sleeps.&#160;</span>Babies can get tangled in them and choke.&#160;</li><li><span>Do keep the room at a comfortable temperature.</span>&#160;If your baby is sweating or his chest feels hot, he may be overheated.</li></ul><p><span>Don&#8217;ts</span></p><ul><li><span>Don&#8217;t use sleep positioners.&#160;</span>These sometimes are called nests or anti-roll pillows. They often are mats or wedges with pillows on either side to help keep your baby in place. The Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) warns that sleep positioners can cause babies to die because of suffocation. &#160;&#160;</li><li><span>Don&#8217;t let your baby sleep in a carrier, sling, car seat or stroller.</span>&#160;Babies who sleep in these items can suffocate. If your baby falls asleep in one, take her out and put her in her crib as soon as you can.</li><li><span>Don&#8217;t put your baby to sleep on soft surfaces, like a waterbed, sofa, soft mattress or cushion.</span></li><li><span>Don&#8217;t keep crib bumpers, loose bedding, toys or other soft objects in your baby&#8217;s crib.</span>&#160;They put your baby in danger of being trapped, strangled or suffocated.</li><li><span>Don&#8217;t use cribs with drop-side rails</span>. Don&#8217;t put portable bed rails on a regular bed. Babies can get stuck in rails and choke. Don&#8217;t try to fix a crib that has broken or missing parts.</li></ul><p><span>How do you put your baby to sleep safely?</span></p><p>Here&#8217;s how to help keep your baby safe when you put her to sleep:</p><ul><li><span>Put your baby to sleep on his back every time until he&#8217;s 1 year old.</span>&#160;It&#8217;s not safe for a baby to sleep on his side or tummy. If your baby can roll from his back to his side or tummy and back again, it&#8217;s OK if he changes positions while sleeping.</li><li><span>Dress your baby in light sleep clothes.&#160;</span>Remove any strings or ties from his pajamas and don&#8217;t cover his head. A blanket sleeper can help keep your baby warm without covering his head or face. It&#8217;s safe to swaddle your baby for sleep until he can roll over onto his tummy. But once he can roll over, stop swaddling. A swaddled baby who is placed on or rolls onto his tummy while sleeping may be more likely to experience SIDS. Swaddling is when you snugly wrap a light blanket around your baby so that it covers most of his body below the neck. &#160;&#160;</li><li><span>Give your baby a pacifier.</span>&#160;Pacifiers may help protect against SIDS. If you&#8217;re&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/baby/breastfeeding-is-best.aspx\" title=\"Breastfeeding is best\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breastfeeding,</a>&#160;wait until your baby is 3 to 4 weeks old or until she&#8217;s used to breastfeeding before giving her a pacifier. If your baby won&#8217;t take a pacifier, don&#8217;t force it. It&#8217;s OK if the pacifier falls out of your baby&#8217;s mouth during sleep. Don&#8217;t hang the pacifier around your baby&#8217;s neck or attach the pacifier to your baby&#8217;s clothing or a stuffed animal. Give your baby a pacifier for naps and at bedtime.</li><li><span>Don&#8217;t use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a way to reduce the risk of SIDS.</span>&#160;These monitors track a baby&#8217;s heart rate and breathing. Some babies need this kind of monitor because of medical problems, but this is rare. There&#8217;s no evidence that the monitors help reduce the risk of SIDS in healthy babies.</li></ul><p><span>How does breastfeeding affect safe sleep?</span></p><p>Breastfeeding for at least the first 6 of your baby&#8217;s life can reduce your baby&#8217;s risk of SIDS.</p><p>It&#8217;s OK to breastfeed your baby in your bed. Before you start feeding, move any bedding and pillows from your bed in case you fall asleep. If you do fall asleep, move your baby to his crib or bassinet as soon as you wake up. Breastfeeding your baby in bed is safer than on a sofa or cushioned chair.</p><p>Babies often fall asleep while breastfeeding, especially when they get full. If you think your baby&#8217;s asleep and hasn&#8217;t finished feeding, try to wake him gently by rubbing his back, tickling his feet, burping him or switching him to the other breast. If your baby&#8217;s not latched on correctly, he may fall asleep. You can break the latch by putting your pinky finger in the side of his mouth. Ask your lactation consultant to help you make sure your baby has a good latch. Latch is when your baby&#8217;s mouth is securely attached to the area around your nipple for breastfeeding.&#160;</p><p><span>Are there other ways to help reduce your baby&#8217;s risk of sleep dangers, including SIDS?</span></p><p>Yes. Here&#8217;s what you can do:</p><ul><li>Make sure your baby gets all their&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/baby/your-babys-vaccinations.aspx\" title=\"Your baby&#8217;s vaccinations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vaccinations</a>. These shots help protect her from serious childhood diseases and may help prevent SIDS. All children should be vaccinated for their own health and so they don&#8217;t spread infections to others.</li><li>Don&#8217;t&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/smoking-during-pregnancy.aspx\" title=\"Smoking during pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smoke</a>&#160;and keep your baby away from other smokers and secondhand smoke (smoke from other people&#8217;s cigarettes, cigars and pipes). Babies who live with smokers are at increased risk of SIDS. Keep your home and your car smoke-free.</li><li>Don&#8217;t smoke,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/alcohol-during-pregnancy.aspx\" title=\"Alcohol during pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drink alcohol</a>&#160;or use harmful drugs&#160;during pregnancy. Babies of mothers who do these things are at increased risk of SIDS. &#160;</li><li>Go to all your prenatal care checkups during pregnancy. Babies of mothers who don&#8217;t get regular prenatal care are at increased risk of SIDS.</li></ul><p><span>Can a bedtime routine help your baby sleep?</span></p><p>Yes. Your baby&#8217;s sleep schedule changes over time, but sticking to a routine can make bedtime easier for the both of you. Start setting a bedtime routine when your baby&#8217;s around 4 to 6 months old.</p><p>Here&#8217;s how to get your baby ready for bedtime:</p><ul><li>Wind down any playtime fun.</li><li>Turn off the phone, television, etc.</li><li>Give your baby a warm bath.</li><li>Softly stroke your baby&#8217;s back.</li><li>Give your baby a pacifier.</li><li>Sing to your baby or play soft music.</li><li>Read your baby a bedtime story.</li></ul><p>Stick to your baby&#8217;s sleep routine as much as you can. Plan ahead if your baby&#8217;s routine may need a temporary change, like if you&#8217;re going out of town travel or attending family parties. Change his bed time the best you can but try to get back to his schedule and routine as soon as possible.</p><p><span>What is tummy time?</span></p><p>Tummy time is when you put your baby on her stomach while she&#8217;s awake. It can help make your baby&#8217;s neck, shoulder and arm muscles stronger. It also helps prevent flat spots on the back of your baby&#8217;s head that she may get from sleeping on her back. Always watch your baby during tummy time or make sure an adult who is awake is watching your baby.</p><p><br></p><p><span>March of Dimes information is not intended nor is it&#10;implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, nor is it intended&#10;to be medical diagnosis or treatment.

You may see lots of machines, small babies in incubators (clear, plastic beds for sick babies), hospital staff and other parents. You may:</p><ul><li>Meet the health care providers taking care of your baby</li><li>Find out about your baby&#8217;s health and the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/common-nicu-equipment.aspx\" title=\"Common NICU equipment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">medical equipment</a>&#160;and treatment she needs to get better</li><li>Find out when you can spend time with your baby and participate in her care</li></ul><p><span>Who takes care of your baby in the NICU?</span></p><p>Your baby gets medical care in the NICU from many providers. These providers make up your baby&#8217;s health care team. Every provider on the team has different skills and is responsible for different parts of your baby&#8217;s care. Providers on your baby&#8217;s health care team may include:</p><ul><li>Neonatologist. This is a pediatrician who has special medical training to take care of sick newborns. A pediatrician is a doctor who takes care of babies and children.</li><li>Pediatric resident. This is a doctor who is getting medical training to take care of babies and children.</li><li>Nurse practitioner (also called NP). An NP is a registered nurse with advanced education and training. &#160;</li><li>Registered nurse (also called RN). An RN has education and training to give medical care.</li></ul><p>Your baby&#8217;s providers may change throughout your baby&#8217;s NICU stay. This depends on your baby&#8217;s condition, the length of time your baby is in the NICU and the way the NICU schedules its staff. For example, in some NICUs, one nurse may be assigned to care for your baby on most days. In other NICUs, your baby may have a different nurse every day. The doctors may change over time, too. Even if the providers change, everyone on your baby&#8217;s health care team works to give your baby the best care possible.</p><p>Talk to your baby&#8217;s providers about your baby&#8217;s condition and any tests and treatments she may need. If you can&#8217;t go to the NICU because of your own condition after giving birth, call the NICU and ask to speak to a provider on her health care team.</p><p><span>How can you care for your baby in the NICU?</span></p><p>You can be part of your baby&#8217;s care in the NICU. When your baby is ready, you can hold him, feed him, bathe him and change his diaper. You may be able to take his temperature and help weigh him. It&#8217;s OK if you feel nervous about doing these things. Your baby&#8217;s nurses can show you what to do.</p><p>You can hold your baby even if he&#8217;s connected to medical equipment. It may take time and practice for you and your baby to get comfortable. If you haven&#8217;t been able to hold your baby, ask the nurses how you can touch and comfort him.</p><p><span>How can you care for multiples in the NICU?</span></p><p>Having one baby in the NICU is challenging enough. So having&#160;<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/being-pregnant-with-twins-triplets-and-other-multiples.aspx\" title=\"Being pregnant with twins, triplets and other multiples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multiples (twins, triplets or more)</a>&#160;in the NICU can be even more demanding. You may feel overwhelmed, like there&#8217;s not enough of you to go around. You may worry about which baby needs you more.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what you can do to help you take care of more than one baby in the NICU:</p><ul><li>Spend time with each baby. Each one has her own personality and needs. Spending time with each baby can help you learn their cues so you know what works to soothe each one. Cues are signals your baby gives to let you know how she feels and what she needs.</li><li>Trust yourself to give each baby what he needs. Once you start learning your baby&#8217;s cues, you&#8217;ll know how to care for each one and not feel so torn between them. You&#8217;ll know what each one needs on any given day or even hour by hour.</li><li>Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer before and between touching each baby. Making sure your hands are clean helps protect your babies and other babies in the NICU from serious infections.</li><li>Ask friends and family members for help, especially if your babies are in different rooms in the NICU or if one baby goes home before the other.</li><li>Check the NICU rules about bringing a baby back to the NICU when you&#8217;re spending time with a baby still in the hospital.</li></ul><p><span>What happens when you go home from the hospital but your baby has to stay in the NICU?</span></p><p>As a parent, it can be hard to leave your baby in the hospital. You may live far away or have to go back to work right after your baby is born. Or you may have older children at home to take care of. You may not be able to spend as much time as you&#8217;d like with your baby. If you don&#8217;t live close to the NICU, ask the staff about free or low-cost hotels in the area for NICU parents. And some NICUs have rooms for parents to sleep in.</p><p><span>What do you tell people about your baby&#8217;s condition?</span></p><p>Many people may ask how your baby is doing. How much you tell people about your baby&#8217;s condition is your choice. You can tell them as much or as little as you want. If you&#8217;re not sure exactly what to say, just say that your baby is in intensive care and you&#8217;re taking things day by day. If you don&#8217;t want to talk, you can thank people for their concern but tell them that you don&#8217;t want to talk about it right now.</p><p>A lot of parents use social media and blogs to update family members and friends about their baby.
